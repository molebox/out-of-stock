This repo houses 2 projects that each showcase a demo ecommerce store. They are made with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

The third project is a [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) studio which has the products dataset that the other two projects use.

I made this project to practice these cool new tech kids on the block (as of July 2021).

All products are out of stock and **_cannot_** be purchased. Hence the name.

<h2>This project is still very much a work on progress</h2>

<p>I'll be tweeting about its progress <a href="https://twitter.com/studio_hungry">@studio_hungry</a></p>
