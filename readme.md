# out of stock

This repo houses 2 projects that each showcase a demo ecommerce store. They are made with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

I made this project to practice these cool new tech kids on the block (as of July 2021).

All products are out of stock and **_cannot_** be purchased. Hence the name.

**This project is still very much a work on progress**
